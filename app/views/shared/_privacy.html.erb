			<h2>Copyright Policy</h2>

infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. 
The address of Simple’s	Designated Agent to Receive Notification of 
Claimed Infringement (“Designated Agent”) is <span class="code">&#109;&#111;&#99;&#46;&#100;&#114;&#97;&#99;&#101;&#108;&#112;&#109;&#105;&#115;&#101;&#104;&#116;&#64;&#116;&#99;&#97;&#116;&#110;&#111;&#99;</span></p>
			<p>It is Simple’s policy to (1) block access to or remove material 
that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been 
illegally copied and distributed by any of our users; and (2) remove and
 discontinue service to repeat offenders.</p>
			<h3>A. Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements:</h3>
			<p>If you believe that material or content residing on the Site 
infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement 
containing the following information, in English, to the Designated 
Agent at <span class="code">&#109;&#111;&#99;&#46;&#100;&#114;&#97;&#99;&#101;&#108;&#112;&#109;&#105;&#115;&#101;&#104;&#116;&#64;&#116;&#99;&#97;&#116;&#110;&#111;&#99;</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act
 on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly 
infringed;</li>
				<li>Identification of works or materials being infringed;</li>
				<li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing 
including information regarding the location of the infringing materials
 that the 	copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail
 so that Simple is capable of finding and verifying its existence;</li>
				<li>Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail address;</li>
				<li>A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the 
material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the 
law; and </li>
				<li>A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information 
provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the 
complaint on 	behalf of the copyright owner. </li>
			</ul>
			<p><h3>B. Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent:</h3></p>
			<ul>
				<li>It is Simple’s policy to remove or disable access to the infringing material;</li>
				<li>to notify the complaining party that the content has been removed or access to the material disabled; and </li>
				<li>that repeat offenders will have the infringing material removed 
from the system and that Simple will terminate such user’s access to 
the website and service.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><h3>C. Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:</h3><br>
			If the user believes that the material that was removed or to which 
access was disabled is either not infringing, or the user believes that 
it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner,
 the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, the user must send
 a counter-notice containing the	following information, in English, to 
the Designated Agent:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A physical or electronic signature of the user;</li>
				<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which
 access has been disabled and the location at which the material 
appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
				<li>A statement that the user has a good faith belief that the 
material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a 
misidentification of the 	material;	and</li>
				<li>User’s name, address, telephone number, and, if available, 
e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity consents to 
the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which
 the user’s address is located, or if the user’s address is located 
outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Simple is
 located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process 
from the person who provided notification 	of the alleged	infringement.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Simple 
may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party 
informing that person that it may replace the removed material or cease 
disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an 
action seeking a court order against the user, the removed material may 
be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days after 
receipt of the counter-notice, at Simple’s discretion.</p>
			<p>The Designated Agent for notice of claims of copyright or other intellectual property infringement can be reached at: <span class="code">&#109;&#111;&#99;&#46;&#100;&#114;&#97;&#99;&#101;&#108;&#112;&#109;&#105;&#115;&#101;&#104;&#116;&#64;&#116;&#99;&#97;&#116;&#110;&#111;&#99;</span></p>

accepted. Accordingly, any notification of infringement submitted 
electronically with an attachment will not be received or processed.</p>
